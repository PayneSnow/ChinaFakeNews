> I was very close to the girl before she got shot in the face.

> It was near the junction of Nathan and Austin Road, by the bus stops. The whole area was full of medics and people in bright yellow clothes, indicating they were not protesters and keeping clear of the main fray at the police gate. Pretty much all the protesters were much further south, down Nathan Rd.

> About 5 minutes before she was shot, I literally saw and heard a white projectile fly past my face. This was not a CS canister as it made a swish sound, and it didn’t make any noise against the shop front like canisters do. I was dressed clearly in yellow and orange. I turned to face the back end of the police station and could just make out a darkened balcony, with about 3 figures on it. Prior to that, you wouldn’t even know there was a balcony there in the night time.

> There was no doubt in my mind, they tried to headshot me and missed. There was no one else within metres of me. Definitely not any black clad protesters. I crouched down behind the wall, and behind one of the large Banyans.

> About 5 minutes later, the girl was shot 15 metres from me.

> There isn’t a single doubt in my mind that who ever was shooting could see they were firing at people who were clearly visible as medics or media.



## 翻譯

> 那位少女面部中槍前，我跟她距離非常近。

> 位置是彌敦道與柯士甸道交界附近的巴士站旁，當時全是救護員和穿鮮黃色衫的人，反映他們並非示威者，而且相距警署門外衝突的主要地點很遠。基本上所有示威者都在彌敦道往南方向，很遠很遠的位置。

>  少女中槍前約5分鐘，我親眼看見並聽得到有白色的投射物，在我臉旁飛過。那不是催淚彈罐，因為它發出了一下「嗖」(swish) 的聲音，而且擊中店舖時是無聲的。我當時的衣服明顯是黃色和橙色。我回過頭來，面向警署的後方，隱若看到個漆黑的露台，上面大概站了3人。我想，平常夜晚應該沒有人會察覺這露台的存在。

>  我毫無懷疑地相信，他們當時想射我的頭，只是射失了，因為我身邊幾米範圍內一個人也沒有，也肯定沒有任何黑衣示威者。我在牆後蹲下，躲在一棵大榕樹後面。

>  大約5分鐘後，少女在距離我15米的位置中槍。我毫無懸念的相信，無論是誰開槍，他們肯定看到自己開槍的目標，很明顯就是救護員或傳媒。
